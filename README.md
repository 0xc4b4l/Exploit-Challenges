# Exploit-Challenges
Here are a collection of vulnerable ARM binaries designed for beginner vulnerability researchers & exploit developers to play around with and test their skills! 

This binaries are all built as ARMv7 Mach-O executables (unless specified otherwise) so it is recommended that you use a 32bit jailbroken iOS device with `radare2` or another debugging utility installed to test them.

## Help & Guidance

Write-ups/explanations on some of the binaries can be found on [my website](http://billyellis.net) or on either one of my YouTube channels [here](https://youtube.com/c/BillyEllis) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCspPUCzEZtMXVK0m3yrh2Zw).
