# Exploit-Challenges
Here are a collection of vulnerable ARM binaries designed for beginner vulnerability researchers & exploit developers to play around with and test their skills! 

These binaries are all built as ARMv7 Mach-O executables (unless specified otherwise) so it is recommended that you use a 32bit jailbroken iOS device with `radare2` or another debugging utility installed to test them.

### ARM 32-bit

`roplevel1` - simple introduction to Return Oriented Programming with a simple objective

`roplevel2` - same idea as level 1 but with a new objective

`roplevel3` - more advanced use of ROP

`roplevel4` - dealing with ASLR (infoleak)

`roplevel5` - same as lvl4 but requires exploitation of format string vuln for the info leak

`heaplevel1` - simple heap based overflow example

`heaplevel2` - Use-After-Free exploit

`Xylex` - real-world(ish) example system

### ARM 64-bit

`roplevel1-64` - 64-bit version of roplevel1


## Help & Guidance

Write-ups/explanations on some of the binaries can be found on [my website](http://billyellis.net) or on either one of my YouTube channels [here](https://youtube.com/c/BillyEllis) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCspPUCzEZtMXVK0m3yrh2Zw).
